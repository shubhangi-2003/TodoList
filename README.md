1. Set up React.js in your VS code:
2. npx create-react-app todoapp
3. npm start

4. Divide your one big project into components:
5. Components: Title.js, Input.js, App.js, InputItem.js and so on...

6. State Management is used so that the data is remembered by the browser whenever page reloads.
7. We have used UseState hook in react which preserves a state.
8. It is an array which stores two variables, one is the initial state and other is to update the state.

9. For passing an information such as a value we use props.
10. App.js is a parent component while title, input and todo are children.
11. Props are used to pass information from a parent to child component. It offers component reusability.

12. There are two event handlers used in this project:
13. OnChange: An onChange event handler is used to describe how would a function act in a following event.
14. We always provide an Event to an onChange handler.
15. It is used to update a state when event triggers eg: To provide input values.
16. OnClick: Another event handler which is used in buttons.
17. It tells what to do when a button is clicked eg: Deletes a task when delete button clicked.

18. We have used Font Awesome for displaying the delete button.
19. It is added by updating the URL to html file.

20. We have added CSS to our list like a little transition to delete button and change in color and our overall appearence.

21. Conclusion: We have worked on various concepts like: COMPONENTS, PROPS, USESTATE, EVENT HANDLERS.
